Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] Libatomic: Add LSE128 atomics support for AArch64
Date: Mon, 13 Nov 2023 11:37:31 +0000	[thread overview]
Message-ID: <20231113113744.70784-1-victor.donascimento@arm.com> (raw)

v2 updates:

Move the previously unguarded definition of IFUNC_NCONDN(N) in
`host-config.h' to within the scope of `#ifdef HWCAP_USCAP'.
This is done so that its definition is not only contingent on the
value of N but also on the definition of HWCAP_USCAP as it was found
that building on systems where !HWCAP_USCAP and N == 16 led to a
previously-undetected build error.

Building upon Wilco Dijkstra's work on AArch64 128-bit atomics for
Libatomic, namely the patches from [1] and [2],  this patch series
extends the library's  capabilities to dynamically select and emit
Armv9.4-a LSE128 implementations of atomic operations via ifuncs at
run-time whenever architectural support is present.

Regression tested on aarch64-linux-gnu target with LSE128-support.
