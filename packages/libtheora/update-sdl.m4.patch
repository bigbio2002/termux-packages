-#
-# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN)
-# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
-# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
-#
-# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
-# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
-# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
-# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
-# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
-#
-# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
-# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
-# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
-# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
-# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6. 
-#
-# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
-# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
-# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
-# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.

+## Usage. ##
+## ------ ##
+
+# Evaluate this file near the top of your script to gain access to
+# the functions and variables defined here:
 #
-#     --config             show all configuration variables
-#     --debug              enable verbose shell tracing
-# -n, --dry-run            display commands without modifying any files
-#     --features           display basic configuration information and exit
-#     --mode=MODE          use operation mode MODE
-#     --preserve-dup-deps  don't remove duplicate dependency libraries
-#     --quiet, --silent    don't print informational messages
-#     --tag=TAG            use configuration variables from tag TAG
-# -v, --verbose            print informational messages (default)
-#     --version            print version information
-# -h, --help               print short or long help message
-#
-# MODE must be one of the following:
-#
-#       clean              remove files from the build directory
-#       compile            compile a source file into a libtool object
-#       execute            automatically set library path, then run a program
-#       finish             complete the installation of libtool libraries
-#       install            install libraries or executables
-#       link               create a library or an executable
-#       uninstall          remove libraries from an installed directory
-#
-# MODE-ARGS vary depending on the MODE.
-# Try `$progname --help --mode=MODE' for a more detailed description of MODE.

+## ------ ##
+## Usage. ##
+## ------ ##
+
+# This file is a library for parsing options in your shell scripts along
+# with assorted other useful supporting features that you can make use
+# of too.
+#
+# For the simplest scripts you might need only:
+#
+#   #!/bin/sh
+#   . relative/path/to/funclib.sh
+#   . relative/path/to/options-parser
+#   scriptversion=1.0
+#   func_options ${1+"$@"}
+#   eval set dummy "$func_options_result"; shift
+#   ...rest of your script...
+#
+# In order for the '--version' option to work, you will need to have a
+# suitably formatted comment like the one at the top of this file
+# starting with '# Written by ' and ending with '# warranty; '.
+#
+# For '-h' and '--help' to work, you will also need a one line
+# description of your script's purpose in a comment directly above the
+# '# Written by ' line, like the one at the top of this file.
+#
+# The default options also support '--debug', which will turn on shell
+# execution tracing (see the comment above debug_cmd below for another
+# use), and '--verbose' and the func_verbose function to allow your script
+# to display verbose messages only when your user has specified
+# '--verbose'.
+#
+# After sourcing this file, you can plug processing for additional
+# options by amending the variables from the 'Configuration' section
+# below, and following the instructions in the 'Option parsing'
+# section further down.
+
+## -------------- ##
+## Configuration. ##
+## -------------- ##
+
+# You should override these variables in your script after sourcing this
+# file so that they reflect the customisations you have added to the
+# option parser.
+
+# The usage line for option parsing errors and the start of '-h' and
+# '--help' output messages. You can embed shell variables for delayed
+# expansion at the time the message is displayed, but you will need to
+# quote other shell meta-characters carefully to prevent them being
+# expanded when the contents are evaled.
+usage='$progpath [OPTION]...'
+
+# Short help message in response to '-h' and '--help'.  Add to this or
+# override it after sourcing this library to reflect the full set of
+# options your script accepts.

+   -W, --warnings=CATEGORY

+
+# These exist entirely to fool aclocal when bootstrapping libtool.
+#
+# In the past libtool.m4 has provided macros via AC_DEFUN (or AU_DEFUN),
+# which have later been changed to m4_define as they aren't part of the
+# exported API, or moved to Autoconf or Automake where they belong.
+#
+# The trouble is, aclocal is a bit thick.  It'll see the old AC_DEFUN
+# in /usr/share/aclocal/libtool.m4 and remember it, then when it sees us
+# using a macro with the same name in our local m4/libtool.m4 it'll
+# pull the old libtool.m4 in (it doesn't see our shiny new m4_define
+# and doesn't know about Autoconf macros at all.)
+#
+# So we provide this file, which has a silly filename so it's always
+# included after everything else.  This provides aclocal with the
+# AC_DEFUNs it wants, but when m4 processes it, it doesn't do anything
+# because those macros already exist, or will be overwritten later.
+# We use AC_DEFUN over AU_DEFUN for compatibility with aclocal-1.6.
+#
+# Anytime we withdraw an AC_DEFUN or AU_DEFUN, remember to add it here.
+# Yes, that means every name once taken will need to remain here until
+# we give up compatibility with versions before 1.7, at which point
+# we need to keep only those names which we still refer to.
+
+# This is to help aclocal find these macros, as it can't see m4_define.
